Try catch
try{a()b()c()}catch(){}
stage detection:memory and fetch
we keep a status register
a stage can modify the status
performance
clock rate is measures in gigahertz billions of cycles per second
function of stage partitioning and circuit design

CPI- cycles per instruction
if sequential = to 1
if pipeline its gonna be higher
CPI of about 1 is best
>1 means sometimes we stall or cancel branches
multiple writebacks allow for <1
C = clock cycles
I = instructions executed to completion
B = bubbles inject CPI = 1.0 + B/I <<- penalty due to stalling

LP = penalty due to load/use
MP = penalty due to mispredicted branches
RP = penalty due to the ret 
Net effect of penalty, add up the results

Paralellism- from lowest lv to highest lv
Instruction level- ILP ins lv parlism- is pipeline
Data-Levels (DLP)
-GPUS have 1000 cores and simply run in paralell to control graphics
-thread level parallelism TLP 
-controlling cores in parallel

Modern CPU design has a 5 stage pipeline but its more complex
fetch decode, instruction cache, execute is highly parallelized, Memory in DataCache, Retirement unit or commitment unit 
lots of paralellism that take different amounts of time, 
orginial scoreboarding algorithm or Thomas algorithm

-GRabs instruction bytes from memory,
hardware dynamically guesses whether brances are taken 
-translate instructions into operations
primitive steps rerquired to perform instructions
typical instruction requres 1-3 ops

Diviion in a processor
basically long division
12*12 120+24, so we use forms of addition 
dividing by the same number is harsh on the processor
instead! calculate the recipercol and multiply!
