8 bits is a byte

Machine words---size defined by processor

32 bit machine is a 32 bit word size
gives 2^32-1 is a 4GB address
4 billion bytes
high end systems --64bit machines support 48 bit adresses which is 256TB
x86 originally 16 bit machine
char--1 byte
short--2bytes
int 4 bytes
long 4 bytes x86 8bytes same as the word size of the machine
