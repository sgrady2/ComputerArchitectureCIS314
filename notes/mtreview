The stack is geographically addressed (gravity works addresses increase up)
the stack ADT however is upside down so theres a hole at the lower top and a ceiling at the upper bottom
the way what ebp and esp is that ebp is the frame pointer to the base stack frame or closer to the bottom of the stack
the esp is closer to the top of the stack

OxFC = 0x000000FC
0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 1111 1100
-128 + 124 = -4

3.25 >> 3 = 11 + .01
11.01 x 2^1
1.101
sig 101
1+127 = 128 = 10000000
0 10000000 101000..

The test includes only 32 bit numbers, no 64 bit shit!! !! !!! !! !!!
cmpl %eax, %edx
je L1
ORDER ONLY MATTERS FOR >=

x = 5x + y+ 12
leal (eax,eax,4), %eax this means x + 4x
leal 12(eax, ebx), %eax


f(unsigned x){
	
	x = x<<2; //multiplies by 4
}

know movl and its relationship to pointers!!
Know addl and leal!!!!
cmpl j* jump instructions!! know thiss only going to ask about 6 standard je jne ect..
^>Labels for jumping L3 L2 ect, practice writing conditionals without curly braces
no structs on the midterm
Arrays storage in memory, know malloc and lookup calculations
Functions %eip (the PC program counter), %ebp %esp return address call ret
takeaway points
using masks could be on the test



finishing assignment 4. 
-finish optimization of problem 2
-lookup objdump and gdb for 4
-start 3
