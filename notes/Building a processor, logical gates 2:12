Building a processor, logical gates 2/12
overview of logic design
hardware requirements
communication
	high or low voltage 01
computation
	computing boolean functions
storage
	store bits on tape or cd

a really simple circuit is a bit equality circuit
we cant build an and gate with 32 inputs but we can make 16 and gates for 2 inputs each

ALU
collection of circiutry doing a lot of the num crunching
continuiously responding to inputs
corresponding to 4 arithmatic/logical operations in y86

final bit
